The smart use of data is revolutionizing nearly every industry in the modern world. Insurance is one of the industries seeing significant change. Insurance companies have some of the most extensive and high-quality customer data in the world. This is simply a result of the close relationship between insurers and their customers. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using customer data to cross sell a different insurance product.  
To facilitate this, a machine learning (ML) model was built and trained using example data. This model analyzed various aspects such as previous vehicle damage, preferred sales channel, and age to make an individualized prediction for the propensity to buy vehicle insurance. All customers were existing health insurance customers, so most of the necessary data would already be available to a company. Methods for collecting the supplementary data are discussed in this report. The predictions from the ML model can then be used to focus marketing efforts on the customers most receptive to the new product. Also discussed is the implementation methodology a health insurer could employ. The model demonstrated high accuracy in identifying promising customers. If implemented, this would mean significant sales and marketing cost savings.
